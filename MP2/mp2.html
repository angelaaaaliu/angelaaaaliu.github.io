        <h1>MP2: P5 Sketches</h1>
        <img class="banner" src="../imgs/MP2.2 Random.png" alt="">
        <p>For this project, I created 6 different sketches with different criteria - static, random, infinite loop, interactive, audio, and audio-visual. You can view the complete sketches
            <a class="standout-link" href="../sketch-gallery/sketch-gallery.html">here</a> or by clicking on 'sketch gallery' on the home page.

        <h2>Development Process</h2>
        <p>Before I began coding, I browsed the p5 website to see what references and shapeforms I could use. I also browsed sites like 
        <a class="standout-link" href="https://openprocessing.org/discover/#/trending">OpenProcessing</a> to get a sense of what designs I liked. I noticed that there was an object
        called a bezier curve that really caught my eye. Below is the bezier curve that ended up being the foundation for my first two sketches.</p>

        <p>I knew that I liked the look of many thin lines put together so that is what inspired sketches 01 and 02.</p>

        <p>Actually, before I had even looked at any inspiration, I thought of making a galaxy-like sketch. My original idea was to create many stars that would glow and orbit
            around each other. I did not end up doing that, but I noticed that there was something called 'WEBGL' and 'orbit control' that allowed me to create 3-D shapes. That is how I ended
            up with the solar system in sketches 03 and 04.

        <p>Originally, I wanted to continue using my solar system for sketch 06 so I decided to just figure out how I would attach my audio to the solar system and that would be my sketch
            05. In my head, I wanted the user to be able to continue to add rings and planets around the center planet. Then, each planet would chime a tone every time it completed a full
            orbit. Thus, for my sound for sketch 05, I needed to allow the user to input multiple tones and frequencies, have the program remember each tone and frequency, and play them all at
            the same time. These were the sketches that I struggled with the most. I will elaborate more on the issues I faced in the 'Issues Deep-Dive' section of this write-up. Eventually,
            I could barely complete the simple visual that you see in my current sketch 06 and was unable to attach it to the solar system visual.

        <h2>Issue Deep Dive</h2>
        <p>For sketch 05, I utilized an object called "sound loops" in p5. It intakes a function and a frequency. Once the sound loops starts, it will run the function every loop.
            I was able to get the sound loop working - I could input a frequency and add a tone. I could then input another frequency and tones will start playing at each frequency.
            However, my program was supposed to iterate through the scale and play the next tone every time the user adds a tone while at the same time playing all previous tones.
            For example, if I add a tone and give it a frequency of 1 second, it should start by playing the C note every 1 second. Then if I add a second tone at a frequency of
            2 seconds, it should start playing the D note every 2 seconds while also playing the C note every 1 second. The issue that I faced was that every time I added a tone,
            all tones will end up playing the same note. In terms of the example I gave, that means that the program would play D every 1 second and D every 2 seconds.
        </p>
        <p>To handle which note the program is supposed to currently be playing, I had a variable named 'currNote' that tracked the current note of the scale. And once it reaches the
            end of the scale, it should loop back to the beginning. I created a function that the each sound loop I created would take in. All this function did was play the current note
             each time any sound loop iterated. What I realized was that the sound loop was calling the function every time it looped, which also meant that as I incremented 'currNote,' EVERY
             SINGLE sound loop I had created would also play that current note. To fix this, I created separate functions for each note. Basically, I have 8 functions and all any of them do
             is play a different note of the scale. Then, whenever I added a tone and created a sound loop, each sound loop would be fed a different function depending on the current note.
        </p>
        <h2>Ideas and Future Work</h2>
        <p>I would still love to somehow match the audio with the rotation of the solar system rings. I think it would be amazing if it turned out right.</p>
        <p>I also want to explore more designs I can do in WEBGL. Another initial idea I had was to create a 3-D bezier curve that rotates or translates in space in a weird way.</p>
        <p>Lastly, my dad has an interesting hobby of astrophography and I think I could use p5 to create some cool assets for a potential website. Maybe I'll do this for my final project!</p>
        <h2>Kudos</h2>
        <p>As usual, thank you to my wonderful boyfriend for listening to me as I used him as a rubber ducky to figure out my code. Even though he knew little about p5, it was helpful
            to just be able to talk it out with him.
