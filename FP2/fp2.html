        <h1>FP1: Final Project Prototype</h1>
        <img class="banner-gif" src="./imgs/fp2.gif" alt="">
        <p>For my final project prototype, I created a photography portfolio of my dad's astrophotography using React.</p>
        <h2>Usage</h2>
        <p>You can access the portfolio <a href="https://angelaaaaliu.github.io/astrophotography-final/">here</a>.</p>
        <h2>Development Process</h2>
        <p>
            Since my prototype was pretty close to my final version, the development process for this project was not necessarily simple, 
            but it was much shorter. I duplicated my Github repository, then used React to add coordinates for each planet when the user
            hovers over them.
        </p>
        <h2>Issue Deep-Dive</h2>
        <p>
            I made only one major change in my React app but this somehow was a lot more work than I anticipated. As mentioned earlier, I wanted
            the coordinates of each photo's galaxy to display when hovering over the corresponding planet.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to do this, I needed to use the useState hook once again to ensure that React re-rendered the page every time the user 
            hovers over a planet and shows the coordinates. I used similar code used to make the photo window show, but this time it the state
            was changed on hover and the state that was being changed was a style object, rather than a boolean. I created a dictionary of
            objects that have attributes of IDs, coordinates, and styles. The ID of each of these "coordinate" objects aligned with the IDs of my photos.
            For example, the Heart Nebula coordinate object had an ID of 1, coordinates "RA 2h 33m 22s | Dec +61° 26′ 36″", and style of 
            {position: "absolute", top: '63.5%', right: '75%'}. I then created a function that changed the state from "display: none" to
            "display: block." I added this function to each planet as a hover event. This function would also filter the dictionary of coordinates
            to only have the one coordinate object corresponding to the ID of the planet the user hovered over. I also made sure to create a 
            function that would change the display back to "none" when the mouse leaves the planet.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next, I needed the position of the coordinates to change depending on which planet I hovered over. For example, if you take a look at 
            the red planet at the bottom left, it represents the Heart Nebula, which has coordinates"RA 2h 33m 22s | Dec +61° 26′ 36″". 
            I also needed the coordinates to show up right below the red planet. This is why I created a style attribute for each coordinate. I used 
            the map function to map each coordinate in the coordinates object dictionary (which since hovering over each planet filtered this 
            dictionary, there should only be one coordinate object). This way I could use its attributes to general an HTML element and stye it as well.
            I used a spreader function to combine two styles: the useState hook, which set the display style, and the style from the dictionary, which
            changed the position of the coordinates on the screen to match the corresponding planet.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although it may sound intuitive now, I actually ran into many roadblocks when trying to achieve this simple interaction. From my prototype 
            version, I had an initial dictionary of photo objects. I initially attempted to add the coordinates as attributes to these objects. 
            I was able to filter it so that only one coordinate was showing up, but when I clicked on any planet to show the photo, all the photos 
            would show up, rather than the photo corresponding to the planet. I realized that this was because when I hovered out of the planet, it
            was executing the function that changed the state of the gallery dictionary to have all galaxies/photos again. This is why I created a
            separate dictionary just for coordinates. This way, the coordinates object would not affect the actual photos themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another issue I was having was styling the coordinates and making sure they were in the correct position. I use in-ine styling to 
            dynamically style the coordinate element to change positions depending on which planet I am hovering over. However, the issue was that I
            was actually taking in two separate style objects, one from the useState hook that set the display, and one from the coordinates object 
            that set the position. I was not sure how to use two style objects and merge them together so that the HTML element was being affected by
            both. I looked up some information on Stack Overflow and saw someone suggest using the Object.assign function. I attempted to do this
            but kept receiving errors. I then tried spreader function and seemed like this was the syntax to get React to do what I wanted it to.
        </p>
        <h2>Ideas and Future Work</h2>
        <p>
            I did initially want to create interesting animations but after doing some research online, I could not find many good tutorials for 
            React specifically and realized that it may be out of the project scope. I would still love to learn more about animating in React or just
            Javascript in general.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also really enjoy using Spline to create 3-D objects and animations so really mastering this API would be really useful for any web 
            design I decide to do in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also realize that I have a small handful of images, which makes it a bit easier to code a website like this. If I were to (or if my
            dad) continue using and building upon this website, I would want to manipulate the code so that it is easier for me to add many
            more photos.
        </p>
        <h2>Kudos</h2>
        <p>Thank you to my dad for providing photos and inspiring this project!</p>
