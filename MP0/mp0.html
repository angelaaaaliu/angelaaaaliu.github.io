        <h2>MP0 Writeup</h2>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>I started creating my site by setting up all pages I would need. I styled the landing page first. I knew that I wanted it to be simple and just have my name.</p>
        <p>I chose a font that I liked from Adobe Font and set that to be the font for my name. I played around with color but then decided to go with a black and white theme, at least for when someone first opens my site.</p>
        <p>I wanted to create an interesting background and grain is a style I like. I also like blobby shapes over uniform rectangles or squares. I decided to combine these elements to create the animation you see now.</p>
        <p>I started working on my projects page next. I knew that I wanted it to be in the form of a simple list. I imagined an italic serif font. I wasn't sure about the background color or the font color.</p>
        <img
        class="picture"
        src="../imgs/MP0 Overview SS.png"
        />
        <p>After playing around, I decided that I wanted my project page to be distinct from my landing page, so I inverted the colors by making the background white and the font color black.</p>
        <h3>Issue</h3>
        <p>One issue I encountered was when I attempted to push my site for the first time I kept getting a message saying that the authentication failed for my Github.</p>
        <p>Through Stack Overflow I learned that, for some reason, I needed a personal access token in order for my VSCode to gain access to my Github.</p>
        <p>I searched up how to get a personal access token in Github and connect to the files in my VS Code and followed the steps I found. I was eventually able to make it work.</p>
        <p>(I also realized that I named my Github repo wrong so I kept typing in what I thought my repo was named for the remote origin URL :P)</p>
        <h3>CSS Transition</h3>
        <p>My CSS transition was inspired by the Verou CSS animation page (https://projects.verou.me/animatable/). I noticed that one of the animations was created by animated the border radius.</p>
        <p>I then Google searched ways to animate the border and came up with what I have right now.</p>

        <h3>Ideas and Future</h3>
        <p>- Creating hover animations</p>
        <p>- Somehow incorporating color</p>
        <p>- Format subpages</p>
