        <h1>FP0: Final Project Proposal</h1>
        <p>For my final project, I will be creating a photography portfolio of my dad's astrophotography using React.</p>
        <h2>Sketches</h2>
        <img class="project-img" src="./imgs/mp3-issue-deepdive.png">
        <h2>Prototype Version Description</h2>
        <p>
          My prototype version will include a basic interactive gallery of photos. Users should be able to interact with the gallery in some way to gain more information
          about each photo. The prototype version will also have a page that provides information about the photographer.
        </p>
        <h2>Final version Description</h2>
        <p>
           The final version will be fully themed and animated. Since the subject of the website is astrophotography, I would like to display the images in a way that makes
           them look like a part of a solar system. You can view photos based on the location of the subject of the photo in relation to the solar system. Once a user clicks
           a planet, the website should zoom in and show the actual picture as well as a brief description.
        </p>
        <h2>Development Process</h2>
        <ol class="bulleted-list">
            <li class="bullet-point">Learn how to get started with React and bundle the library with my local code.</li>
            <li class="bullet-point">Figure out the architecture of my site. Do I want the 'About' page to be a separate page or just another section on the index page?</li>
            <li class="bullet-point">Create all pages and files for my website. (index.html, index.js, index.css)</li>
            <li class="bullet-point">Learn more about solar system mappings and how I can add that to the background of my website.</li>
            <li class="bullet-point">Create interactions that will make photos generate and add photo descriptions. This will be enough for my prototype version.</li>
            <li class="bullet-point">Code animations (if time allows). I want to create a Zooming effect on a "star" that turns into a photo and makes the background a Zoomed-in version of
                the larger solar system.
            </li>
            <li class="bullet-point">Finalize styles.</li>
            <li class="bullet-point">Populate data in 'About' page and style it.</li>
            <li class="bullet-point">Deploy the final version to Github.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Unknowns</h2>
        <ul class="bulleted-list">
            <li class="bullet-point">How to bundle React.</li>
            <li class="bullet-point">Learning React syntax.</li>
            <li class="bullet-point">How to animate with React.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Stretch Goals</h2>
        <p>Creating a website using a language that I do not know at all is already a stretch goal in my opinion. On top of that, I do want my site to be somewhat polished and usable
            for my dad to showcase his photos. This means that I want everything to be cleanly styled and to have animations that tie the site together. I believe this will be the hardest
            aspect of this project.
